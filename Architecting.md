## Architecting

- Two kinds of mappings: autogenerated and static
- Have a mappings subfolder with files for specific mods
- Remote interface so mods can add their own mappings
- Sets are scrolled through according to their "order" property
- local-data translates all of the sets into a runtime-optimized version that is kept outside of global

- Each mapped object has an item name and an order
- Sorted according to their order
- "Relatives" are scrolled with shift, and "Groups" are scrolled with control
- When scrollilng groups, it will scroll to a relative with the same order
  - If no such relative exists, nothing will happen (?)
