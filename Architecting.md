## Architecting

- Two kinds of mappings: autogenerated and static
- Have a mappings subfolder with files for specific mods
- Remote interface so mods can add their own mappings
- Sets are scrolled through according to their "order" property
- local-data translates all of the sets into a runtime-optimized version that is kept outside of global
