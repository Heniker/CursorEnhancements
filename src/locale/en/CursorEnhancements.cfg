cen-category-title=Lorem ipsum.
cen-ghost-transitions=When you run out of an item that places an entity, the mod will automatically switch you over to placing entity ghosts. The reverse is also true - if you have an entity ghost and the ghost's item enters your inventory, the actual item will be placed into your cursor.\n\nIf in cheat mode or the map editor, more items will be spawned into your cursor instead of using the ghost cursor. This can be disabled in the mod settings.
